# This is the 2016 version of my portfolio. It's:

- **responsive** across all major browsers and platforms **without the use of any framework or media queries**. Ie, it (should) render appropriately on any Android, iPhone, iPad, Windows PC, Mac, etc. using any reletively recent browser - including Samsung's!).
- maintains accessibility using **semantically correct HTML** without needing WAI-ARIA attribute enhancements. Try using the keyboard instead of the mouse to navigate the page (<TAB> to navigate links, for example).
- **no CSS class names are used** (uses element names and pseudo-selectors for element attribute declarations. Done to demonstrate a more nuanced knowledge of CSS (in lieu of production-level best practices.
- uses **only vanilla javascript**.
